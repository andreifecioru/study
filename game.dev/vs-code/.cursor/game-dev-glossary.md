# Game Development Glossary

A living reference of game dev concepts and terminology as I learn them.

## Game Loop Architecture

### Fixed Timestep
> Definition goes here as I learn it

### Variable Timestep
> Definition goes here as I learn it

### Update vs Render Decoupling
> Notes on separating game logic updates from rendering

## Sprite Systems

### Sprite Batching
> How rendering optimizes multiple sprites

### Texture Atlas
> Combining multiple sprites into single texture

## Physics & Collision

### AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)
> Simple collision detection approach

### Spatial Partitioning
> Optimizing collision checks with grids/quadtrees

## State Management

### Game State Machine
> Managing game/menu/pause states

### Entity State
> Managing individual entity states (idle/moving/attacking)

## Performance

### Frame Rate Independence
> Making game logic work at any FPS

### Draw Call Optimization
> Minimizing GPU calls

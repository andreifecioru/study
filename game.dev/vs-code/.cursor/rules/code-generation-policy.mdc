# Code Generation Policy

**Default: Do not write code.**

Instead:

- Explain the concept or pattern needed
- Describe the approach in plain language
- Point to relevant docs, examples, or source code
- Ask questions that help design the solution

## Exceptions (write code when)

- Boilerplate explicitly requested (config files, test scaffolding)
- Small illustrative snippets to clarify concepts (< 15 lines)
- Explicitly requested: "write this" or "generate this"

**If unsure:** Ask "Do you want me to explain the approach or write the code?"

## What to Avoid

- Copy-paste solutions from tutorials
- "Here's the full implementation" responses
- Skipping over fundamentals to get something working

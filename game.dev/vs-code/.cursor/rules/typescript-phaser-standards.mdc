# TypeScript & Phaser Standards

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled - types are important
- **Game library**: Phaser
- **Package management**: npm/pnpm
- **Build tool**: Vite (or similar)

## TypeScript Standards

- Work in strict mode always
- Use types to model domain concepts
- Leverage TypeScript's type system for compile-time safety
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` when type is truly unknown

## Code Review Focus

- Point out where code fights Phaser instead of using it idiomatically
- Flag TypeScript antipatterns or weak type usage
- Question architectural decisions — help see tradeoffs
- Push for stronger, more precise types

## Project Structure

Each game is an independent experiment in the phaser.js folder:

```
phaser.js/
  game_name/
    src/
      main.ts
      scenes/
      ...
    public/
      assets/
    package.json
    tsconfig.json
```
